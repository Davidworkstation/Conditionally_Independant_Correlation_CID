# Conditionally_Independant_Correlation_CID
 The Conditionally Independent Copula (CID) is a statistical model used to describe the joint distribution of multiple variables. It assumes that the variables are marginally independent but can exhibit dependence when conditioned on a subset of variables. This allows CID to capture complex dependencies that traditional copulas may overlook.
